C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs.
C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of 
UNIX.C++ is closer to the compiler and faster than C language.
C++ is both a procedural and an object-oriented programming language. It supports OOP features 
such as polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance. As C++ is an object-oriented programming 
language so it gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering 
development costs 


## Variables

A variable is the title of a reserved region allocated in memory. In other words, it may be referred 
to as the name of a memory location.

Syntax for Declaring a Variable: 
<data_type> <variable_name>

Example:
int x = 10; // here int is the data type and x is variable
int y = 50;
Changing values of variables: A variable's value can also be changed in the program. 

Example : 
int x = 10;
x = 20; // now the value changes to 20
int z = 30;
z = 40; // now the value changes to 40

NOTE: Assigning value to variable while declaring is optional.

## Variables Naming Rules

Variables can start from an alphabet or underscore _ or $.
Special characters except _ and $ are not allowed.
Some particular keywords are not allowed.
Commas or blanks are not allowed.
A variable name cannot start with a digit

### Data Types in C++

Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. Hence, by 
assigning different data types, we can store integers, decimals, or characters in these variables.

The different types are :

C++ int: int keyword is used to indicate integers.
C++ char: This data type is used to store a single character.
C++ bool: A Boolean data type is declared with bool keyword.
C++ float : float is used to store floating-point numbers (decimals and exponentials).
C++ double: double is used to store floating-point numbers (decimals and exponentials).
C++ void: The void keyword means "nothing" or "no value"

Identifiers in C++

It is a name given to a package, class, interface, method, or variable. All identifiers must have 
different names.
Rules for identifiers in C++ are :
All identifiers should begin with a letter (A to Z or a to z), $ and _ and must be unique.
After the first character/letter, identifiers can have any combination of characters.
A keyword cannot be used as an identifier.
The identifiers are case sensitive.
Whitespaces are not permitted.
Examples of Identifiers in C++ are: 
abc, _abc, __xyz
