# Printing Number 

cout<< "  "; in between double code you write 
The compiler does not need to parse the code that you write after the space( you write in between double code compiler), so it will print the same output regardless of what you write.

If you write a C++ statement without the double code cout <<, the compiler will treat it as a mathematical expression and evaluate it.
