# C++ Operators

Operators are the symbols that are used to perform pre-defined operations on variables and 
values (commonly referred to as operands).

Operators in C++ can be classified into 6 types:

Arithmetic Operators

Relational Operators

Logical Operators

Assignment Operators

Bitwise Operators

Miscellaneous Operator

 ## Logical operators :
 
 Logical operators are used for decision-making. This class of operators is used to check whether an expression is true or false. Some of the commonly used logical operators are mentioned in the table below

## C++ assignment operators:
It assigns the value of its right hand operator to a variable or a property given by its left 
hand operator

## Miscellaneous Operator

Conditional operator (?:): The conditional operator is a ternary operator that takes three operands. The first operand is a condition, the second operand is the value of the expression if the condition is true, and the third operand is the value of the expression if the condition is false.

Comma operator (,): The comma operator is a binary operator that evaluates its operands from left to right and returns the value of the last operand.

sizeof operator (sizeof()): The sizeof operator returns the size of a variable or an object in bytes.

Address of operator (&): The address of operator returns the address of a variable or an object.

Dereference operator (*): The dereference operator returns the value of the variable or object that is pointed to by the address.
