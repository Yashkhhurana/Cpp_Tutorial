# Hello World!

This is a simple C++ program that prints "Hello World!" to the console.

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program to print a "Hello World!".

retuen 0; is optional you add or not is your choice 

##  #include<iostream>
Use code with caution. Learn more
This line tells the compiler to include the iostream header file. The iostream header file contains the definition of the cout object, which is used to output text to the console.

## using namespace std;
Use code with caution. Learn more
This line tells the compiler to use the std namespace. The std namespace contains all of the standard library functions, including cout.

 ## int main(){
Use code with caution. Learn more
This line defines the main() function. The main() function is the entry point of every C++ program.

## cout<<"hello world";
Use code with caution. Learn more
This line uses the cout object to output the "hello world" text to the console.

## return 0;// optional to use return 0;  
}           

This line returns the value 0 from the main() function. The value 0 indicates that the program terminated successfully.

The return 0; line is optional. If you omit this line, the compiler will still return 0 from the main() function.

I hope this explanation is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## How to Run the Program

To run the program, you can save the code as `hello_world.cpp and then compile it on vs code, codespace, or online compiler
